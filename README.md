# HTTP5204 Passion Project MVP: Up-Next
**This is the final submission version of my MVP for my HTTP5204 Passion Project: Up-Next Store**

For my passion project, my goal was to create an ecommerce website called "Up-Next", which would allow users to post vintage/streetwear items that they want to sell, while also allowing other users to add these items to an order that they could purchase. 

I was able to complete the administrative side of the website, which allows a user with an admin account to be able to view the entire user and product database. The admin is able to view, add, edit, and delete users/products to the website. The additional features I was able to include are the search feature, image uploading, and 

Ideally, a user that logins in with a "regular" account would be able to add products. However, the edit and delete features would only be accessible for products that the regular user owns. If they do not own the product, they can only view the product's details and add the product to a cart/order. A regular user would not have access to add, edit, or delete other users. They would only be able to view other users accounts (as well as all the products they are selling), as well as edit/delete their own account. I will be looking into adding this feature in the near future!

Additional features that I hope to add to my project in the future are listed below.
